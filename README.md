# Image Effects

This is mostly a playground to play around with WebGL fragment shaders using THREE.js. Currently there is only one effect to adjust (pixelation) but there may be more in the future.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/slammayjammay/image-effects.git
$ cd image-effects
$ npm install
```

Run the repo as an electron app:
```sh
$ npm run build && npm run electron
```

Or package it as a distributable app:
```sh
$ npm run package:darwin # for macs
$ npm run package:win32 # for windows
```
